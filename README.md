Android BasicNotifications Sample
===================================

A basic app showing how to display events in the system's notification bar using
the NotificationCompat API.
NotificationCompat API is used for compatibility with older devices, running Android
1.6 (Donut) (API level 4) or newer.

Introduction
------------

The [Notification API][1] allows the app developers to display a message outside
of your application's normal UI.

The class [Notification][2] was added in the Android 3.0 (API level 11), but this
sample refers to the [NotificationCompat][3] class (part of the [support library][4]),
 which offers the same functionality for Android 1.6 (API level 4) or newer.

A Notificaiton can be created using Notification.Builder object.
At bare minimum, a Builder object must include the following:
- A small icon, set by [setSmallIcon()][5]
- A title, set by [setContentTitle()][6]
- Detail text, set by [setContentText()][7]

in the code snippet, it looks like following.
```java
NotificationCompat.Builder builder = new NotificationCompat.Builder(this);
builder.setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_stat_notification);
builder.setContentTitle("BasicNotifications Sample");
builder.setContentText("Time to learn about notifications!");
```

To issue the notification, call notify() method in the [NotificationManager][8].
The code snippet will immediately display the notification icon in the
notification bar.

```java
NotificationManager notificationManager = (NotificationManager) getSystemService(
        NOTIFICATION_SERVICE);
notificationManager.notify(NOTIFICATION_ID, builder.build());
```
